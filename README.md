# A collection of what I do.

This repository is meant to contain a collection of projects I work on in my spare time.

## Projects

## Single-script(ish) games
### cube.js
A game script that animates multiple cubes (yes, they're actually rectangles) moving around the webpage. 
- Populates the page with article elements representing the cubes
- Pre-existing article elements can be clicked to pause the game

### pattern.js
A script for generating randomized line patterns on a canvas.
- Highly customizable with an adjustable menu at the top
- No end goal, just potentially pretty drawings

### snake.js
A classic Snake game implementation using canvas.
- There is a high-score that's kept track of, but resets when the page is reloaded

### loop.js
Inspired by the loop traps from the flash game series Submachine by Mateusz Skutnik.
- Allows player movement in a looping environment
- Players wrap around to the opposite side when reaching the edge
- Press the spacebar to toggle a "flashlight"

## Dependencies / prerequisites
- Currently, there are no dependencies or prerequisites. Simply download the project and run it in a local enviroment (the browser)

## Future Improvements
- No amount of data is currently being stored and reused (whether it's via a database or cookies), not much of a reason for anyhow (rip snake high-score)
- Only the pattern.js file is configurable using a menu, eventually will (should) be added as a functionality to other scripts
- Currently, the repository primarity contains javascript, this will change soon enough...
- Should include a button to go back to the main menu
- Managed to forget most of the errors I need to account for at the time of writing this, oh well!
- Input validation? Yea, it's valid
- Error handling? What's that?
- Browser compatibility? Never heard of him
- What do you mean an IIFE isn't the same as a module?
