A collection of what I do.

[cube.js]
Game script to have a bunch of cubes move around.
There is one article element which you can click which reloads the page on click.

[pattern.js]
Game script for drawing randomised lines in random ways, very adjustable with a menu included at the top.

[snake.js]
To be made...

P.S: I have yet to properly read the standard ways of writing readme files and do documentation.
