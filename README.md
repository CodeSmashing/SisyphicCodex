A collection of what I do.

[cube.js]
Game script to have a bunch of cubes move around. Webpage is populated with article elements to represent the cubes.
There is one article element which you can click which pauses the game on click.

[pattern.js]
Script for drawing randomised lines in random ways on a canvas, very adjustable with a menu included at the top.

[snake.js]
Game script to play snake on a canvas.

P.S: I have yet to properly read the conventions of writing readme files and how to do documentation.
